    SI 539 - Discussion 6: SOLUTION FILE
    ====================================
    This is the complete solution for teaching team reference.
    Students should NOT see this file.

    The navigation, hero section, and footer are already fully styled
    in starter_style.css. This solution adds:

    1. Accessibility features (skip link, focus states)
    2. Responsive grid layouts for the 6 content cards

    KEY CONCEPT — Container vs. Item:
    • CONTAINER (parent): display: grid, grid-template-columns, gap
    • ITEM (child):       grid-column, grid-row, order
*/



/* =====================================================
   PART 1: ACCESSIBILITY (Steps 1–3)
   ===================================================== */


/* --- Step 1: Hide the Skip Link Off-Screen ---
 *
 * Position the .skip-link above the viewport so it's
 * hidden but still accessible to screen readers.
 * Give it button-like styling (background, color, padding)
 * so it looks good when it appears in Step 2.
 */

.skip-link {
    position: absolute;
    top: -60px;
    left: 0;
    background-color: #2980b9;
    color: white;
    /* padding: 10px 20px; */
    z-index: 1000;
}


/* --- Step 2: Show the Skip Link on Focus ---
 *
 * When .skip-link receives :focus, move it back
 * into view so keyboard users can see it.
 */

.skip-link:focus {
    top: 10px;
}


/* --- Step 3: Focus Styles on Nav Links ---
 *
 * Add a clearly visible focus indicator to nav a
 * so keyboard users can tell which link is selected.
 * The default browser outline is hard to see on the
 * dark nav background — make yours stand out.
 */

nav a:focus {
    outline: 3px solid #3498db;
    outline-offset: 4px;
}

/* --- Step 4: Mobile Base Styles (1 Column) ---
 *
 * GOAL: Stack the 6 content sections vertically with
 *       some padding and spacing between them.
 *
 * Make .content-container a single-column grid with
 * gap between sections and some padding around the edges.
 */

.content-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    gap: 20px;
    padding: 20px;
}


/* --- Step 5: Tablet at 768px (2 Columns) ---
 *
 * GOAL: Display the 6 cards in a 2-column grid (3 rows).
 *
 * Change .content-container to a 2-column grid.
 */

@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    .content-container {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
        gap: 30px;
        padding: 30px;
    }

    /* --- Step 6: Make Cards 3 and 6 Span All Columns ---
     *
     * Make the 3rd and 6th content cards span across all columns.
     * Using -1 means this works for both tablet (2 cols) and desktop (3 cols).
     */

    .content-section:nth-child(3),
    .content-section:nth-child(6) {
        grid-column: 1 / -1;
    }
}


/* --- Step 7: Desktop at 1024px (3 Columns) ---
 *
 * GOAL: Display all 6 cards in a 3-column grid (2 rows).
 *       Override the spanning from Step 6 so all cards are equal width.
 *
 * Change .content-container to a 3-column grid and reset
 * cards 3 and 6 to span only 1 column.
 */

@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
    .content-container {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
        gap: 40px;
        padding: 40px;
    }

    /* Override Step 6: Reset cards 3 and 6 to normal width */
    .content-section:nth-child(3),
    .content-section:nth-child(6) {
        grid-column: auto;
    }
}
