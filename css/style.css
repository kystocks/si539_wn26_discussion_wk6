    Edit ONLY this file. Follow the TODO steps.

    The navigation, hero section, and footer are already fully styled
    in style.css. Your job is to:

    1. Add accessibility features (skip link, focus states)
    2. Create responsive grid layouts for the 6 content cards
*/



/* --- Step 1: Hide the Skip Link Off-Screen ---
 *
 * TODO: Position the skip-link above the viewport so it's
 *       hidden but still accessible to screen readers.
 *       Give it button-like styling (background, color, padding)
 *       so it looks good when it appears in Step 2.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Add z-index: 1000 so the skip link appears ABOVE
 *            the sticky nav (which has z-index: 100).
 */

/* YOUR CODE: */




/* --- Step 2: Show the Skip Link on Focus ---
 *
 * TODO: When the skip-link receives :focus, move it back
 *       into view so keyboard users can see it.
 *
 * HINT: Change the top value to something visible.
 */

/* YOUR CODE: */




/* --- Step 3: Focus Styles on Nav Links ---
 *
 * TODO: Add a clearly visible focus indicator to nav a
 *       so keyboard users can tell which link is selected.
 *       The default browser outline is hard to see on the
 *       dark nav background — make yours stand out.
 *
 * HINT: Try outline:  and outline-offset:
 */

/* YOUR CODE: */





/* --- Step 4: Mobile Base Styles (1 Column) ---
 *
 * GOAL: Stack the 6 content sections vertically with
 *       some padding and spacing between them.
 *
 * TODO: Make .content-container a single-column grid with
 *       gap between sections and some padding around the edges.
 */

/* YOUR CODE for .content-container: */




/* --- Step 5: Tablet at 768px (2 Columns) ---
 *
 * TODO: Write a media query for 768px and up.
 *       Change .content-container to a 2-column grid.
 *       You may want to adjust the gap for this layout.
 *
 */

/* YOUR CODE: */




         /* --- Step 6: Make Cards 3 and 6 Span All Columns ---
         *
         * GOAL: Make the 3rd and 6th content cards span across
         *       all columns in the grid
         *
         * TODO: Target the 3rd and 6th
         *       .content-section elements. Make them span
         *       both columns.
         *
         * IMPORTANT: This rule should be INSIDE your tablet media
         *            query (from Step 5) so it applies at 768px and up.
         *

         /* YOUR CODE: (add this inside your Step 5 media query) */




/* --- Step 7: Desktop at 1024px (3 Columns) ---
 *
 * GOAL: Display all 6 cards in a 3-column grid (2 rows).
 *       All cards should be equal width.
 *
 * TODO: Write a media query for 1024px and up.
 *       Change .content-container to a 3-column grid.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: You also need to OVERRIDE the spanning rule from Step 6
 *            so that cards 3 and 6 go back to normal width (1 column each).
 *            Use grid-column: auto to reset them.
 *
 * HINT: Your media query should call TWO classes:
 *       1. .content-container with grid-template-columns
 *       2. .content-section:nth-child(3) and :nth-child(6) with grid-column: auto
