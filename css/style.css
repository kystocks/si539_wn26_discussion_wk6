/*
    SI 539 - Discussion 6: YOUR Stylesheet
    =======================================
    Edit ONLY this file. Follow the TODO steps.

    KEY CONCEPT — Container vs. Item:
    • CONTAINER (parent): display: grid, grid-template-columns, gap
    • ITEM (child):       grid-column, grid-row, order

    Ask yourself: "Am I styling the container or the item?"

/* =====================================================
   PART 1: ACCESSIBILITY (Steps 1–3)
   ===================================================== */


/* --- Step 1: Hide the Skip Link Off-Screen ---
 *
 * TODO: Position the .skip-link above the viewport so it's
 *       hidden but still accessible to screen readers.
 *       Give it button-like styling (background, color, padding)
 *       so it looks good when it appears in Step 2.
 */

/* YOUR CODE: */




/* --- Step 2: Show the Skip Link on Focus ---
 *
 * TODO: When .skip-link receives :focus, move it back
 *       into view so keyboard users can see it.
 */

/* YOUR CODE: */




/* --- Step 3: Focus Styles on Nav Links ---
 *
 * TODO: Add a clearly visible focus indicator to nav a
 *       so keyboard users can tell which link is selected.
 *       The default browser outline is hard to see on the
 *       dark nav background — make yours stand out.

/* =====================================================
   PART 2: RESPONSIVE GRID (Steps 4–6)
   =====================================================
   Mobile-first:
     Base styles       → mobile (1 column)
     @media 768px      → tablet (2 columns)
     @media 1024px     → desktop (4 columns, alternating)
*/


/* --- Step 4: Mobile Base Styles (1 Column) ---
 *
 * TODO: Make .content-container a single-column grid with
 *       some space between sections.
 *
 * TODO: Make each .content-section its own single-column
 *       grid so the image stacks above the text.
 */

/* YOUR CODE for .content-container: */



/* YOUR CODE for .content-section: */




/* --- Step 5: Tablet at 768px (2 Columns) ---
 *
 * TODO: Write a media query for 768px and up.
 *       Change each .content-section to display its image
 *       and text side by side in two equal columns.
 *       Vertically center the items within their row.
 *
 * TODO: Make the second section look different by pushing
 *       its image to the right side using the order property.
 */

/* YOUR CODE: */




/* --- Step 6: Desktop at 1024px (4 Columns, Alternating) ---
 *
 * TODO: Write a media query for 1024px and up.
 *
 * This step has three parts — you need BOTH container
 * and item properties to make it work.
 *
 * A) CONTAINER: Change .content-section to a 4-column grid.
 *
 * B) ITEMS: Make .section-image span the left two columns and
 *    .section-text span the right two columns. Force both onto
 *    the same row.
 *
 *    Column LINES for a 4-column grid:
 *      1     2     3     4     5
 *      | col | col | col | col |
 *
 * C) ALTERNATING: For the 2nd section only, flip it —
 *    text on the left two columns, image on the right two columns.
 *    Use :nth-child(2) to target that section.

   PART 3: BONUS — Flexbox Footer (if you finish early)
   =====================================================
 *
 * TODO: Convert the footer to use Flexbox for centering
 *       instead of text-align.
