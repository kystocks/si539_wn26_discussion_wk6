# SI 539 — Discussion 6: Responsive Grid & Accessibility

## Overview

## Setup
1. Download or clone this folder to your computer.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. If you have the Live Server extension, right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server." Otherwise, open `index.html` directly in Chrome.
4. Open `css/style.css` — this is the only file you will edit.
5. Follow the TODO comments in `style.css` and the steps on your worksheet.

## Testing Your Work
- **Mobile**: Resize your browser to below 768px wide, or use Chrome DevTools device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M / Cmd+Shift+M).
- **Tablet**: Resize to 768px–1023px.
- **Desktop**: Resize to 1024px or wider.
- **Accessibility**: Press Tab repeatedly to test keyboard navigation. The skip link should appear on the first Tab press. Nav links should show a visible focus outline.

## What You'll Build
You'll create a responsive layout with 6 content cards that rearrange based on screen size:
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: 1 column - cards stack vertically
- **Tablet (768px - 1023px)**: 2 columns - cards in a 2-column grid
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: 3 columns - cards in a 3-column grid

## Submitting
Follow the instructions on your worksheet for what to paste and screenshot.
